Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto in response to the 2008 global financial crisis and the need for a decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system. 
Nakamoto's vision was to create a currency free from central control, censorship-resistant, and capable of secure, borderless transactions.
\subsection{Demand \& Supply of Bitcoin}
We have to ensure that supply and demand of bitcoin must be regulated otherwise it may cause inflation, satoshi takes care of supply.
Demand is regulated by market it is not controlled by anyone.
\subsection{Double Spend Problem}
We have to ensure that money should be only spent once.
Satoshi came up with an idea called ownership of bitcoin that everybody knows how much each owner has with the help of peer to peer netwoks.
Satoshi also ensured that Anonymity between the owners i.e that they are known by public key.
They use hash function to encode the transactions and mining purpose.
Satoshi also came up with proof of work by which the bitcoin can be used as Cryptocurrency.
Block chains are tamperproof transactions once added cannot be modified, each block in the blockchain has the hash of the previous block.
Transactions are smart contracts in the block are executed one by one and update the ownership of bitcoin.
smart contracts are peice of code in which money is spent by owner signature, popular smart contracts are eherium, ICO.
